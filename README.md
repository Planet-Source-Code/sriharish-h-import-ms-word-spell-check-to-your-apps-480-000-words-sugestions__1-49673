### Description

Its ok to have your own spell check but Who wants to install a 5 MB Dictionary File with their application. The best solution is to borrow a DLL from MS WORD, is this not a simple solution. This code now imports Dictionary of the MsWord to its own application. It verifies the grammatical errors and suggests the correct word replacement. Have a look at screenshot. This is really a nice example. It also had a very good Find and Replace Example. Try it and you will know.
